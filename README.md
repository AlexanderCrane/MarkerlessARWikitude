# MarkerlessARWikitude
Using Wikitude's examples, I was able to create my own scene with markerless augmented reality using plane detection. This project requires the user to map the four corners of the room, and reconstructs a sci-fi environment based on the room's dimensions. Note that my specific work is located in the "AlexScripts" folder.
